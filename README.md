### License 
The font is licensed under the [SIL Open Font License](./LICENSE.txt). The license gives you permission to use them online and redistribute/modify/study them so long as you keep the resulting fonts under the Open Font License. _I'm not a lawyer and I can't give legal advice, so make sure to read the [official OFL FAQs](./LICENSE-FAQ.txt)._

## Fonts
The folowing font families are included (with bold and italics):

## Delivery
Files are served via jsDelivr, an free, open-source CDN supported by companies like CloudFlare. jsDelivr serves ~72 billion requests/month and is has been reliable for me; however, there's no such thing as a free lunch and I cannot guarantee 100% uptime.  Use it at your own risk.
